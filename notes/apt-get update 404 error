Something I always try to do whenever I am updating Ubuntu 12.04 packages is make sure I will be downloading them from the closest/best mirror/server.

    Select edit from the menu bar, then select Software Sources. ..

Software Center Edit Menu

    Click the drop down arrow for the Download From options.

Package Sources download options

    Choose other.

    Click "Select Best Server."

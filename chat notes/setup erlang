1) clone the repo for the require otp ( in our case 17.5 .. erts-6.4)
    or download the source code and unzip the files to a folder

 2) Go to the folder

3) export ERL_TOP=`pwd`   [ saves current path to a variable ]

4) ./otp_build autoconf   [generate the config scripts ] 

5) ./configure

6) make  [ builing the otp version ]

7) make install    [ installing the build ]

8)export PATH=$ERL_TOP/bin:$PATH  
 [setting the path variable , this is the most crucial step whcih enables erl run on the terminal from anywhere, also enables erlc and other included scripts] 


DONE.NOW check which erl.
It should point to the unziped directory path .

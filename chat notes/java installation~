The tar.gz provided by Oracle don't have an actual installation process. You just extract those files to a location you want and add them to your path. So the process is the following:

    Download a .tar.gz from Oracle (here I will be using jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz);
    Extract it to somewhere;

    Move the extracted folder to /usr/lib/jvm. This is not required but it is the place where Java runtime software is installed

    sudo mv /path/to/jdk1.8.0_20 /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8

    Create a file /etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh with the following content (adapt the paths to reflect the path where you stored your JDK):

    export J2SDKDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8
    export J2REDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre
    export PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre/bin:$PATH
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8
    export DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/db

Done! Those paths will only be recognized after you logout or restart, so if you want to use them right away run source /etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh.
